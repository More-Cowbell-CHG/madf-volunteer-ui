            The Making a Difference Foundation was born out of the compassion and generosity of the employees at CHG Healthcare. Each year these incredible people give of their time, resources, and money, to make their communities a better place. In December of 2016 the executive team of CHG Healthcare created the Making a Difference Foundation with the belief that every person can create a ripple effect of positive change in the world.
